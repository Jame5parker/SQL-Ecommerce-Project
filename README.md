## 💬 About Me
Individual looking to transition into data analysis through a strong passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.
My work focuses on uncovering trends, optimizing performance, and creating clear visual stories that connect data to real-world impact.
I enjoy exploring data across domains — from business operations and customer behavior to marketing performance and financial trends.
I’m experienced with tools such as Excel, SQL, and Python, and I’m comfortable handling end-to-end analytics workflows: data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
As I continue to develop I am expanding my learning into new analytical techniques (machine learning and AI), experimenting with visualization tools, or studying real-world business cases to better understand how data informs decision-making.
